**Describe the bug**
A short description of the issue.

**To Reproduce**
Please provide a concrete Jest test case that reproduces the issue.

If you're not familiar with Jest, look at the existing tests. It's piece of cake and the best way to describe your issue. It also defines exactly when to close the issue (if the test is integrated into the official tests and no longer fails).
Thus, I will not handle issues without a corresponding test case being provided.

**Version(s)**
With which version(s) does the issue occur?

**Additional context**
